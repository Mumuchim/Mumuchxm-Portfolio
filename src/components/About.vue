    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a Computer Science graduate passionate about building interactive 
      and efficient systems. I enjoy solving problems through code and 
      exploring creative applications of programming, including game concepts 
      and user-focused applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve developed interactive projects using Python and C++, strengthening 
      my understanding of logic, UI design, and system behavior. I’m also 
      exploring pixel art and visual design to better understand the creative 
      side of development.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I’m still discovering where I best fit in the industry, I’m highly 
      adaptable, eager to learn, and excited to contribute as an Associate 
      Software Developer in real-world projects.
